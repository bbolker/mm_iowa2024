* Pick a data set from the list: if in doubt, choose `fire_diversity`. 
* Load the data set. 
* **optionally** use `ggplot2`, or the tool of your choice, to visualize the data, paying particular attention to grouping structure.
* **optionally** identify the *maximal model* for the data set
* fit a model of your choice, using either `lme4` (or `lmerTest`) or `glmmTMB`
   * if using the `fire_diversity` data set, consider fixed effects `NPP_log_sc` and `Feat_log_sc`, and grouping variable `biome`
* check diagnostics using `DHARMa` or `performance::check_model()`
* examine the output of `summary()` and draw conclusions
* draw a coefficient plot using `dotwhisker` or another tool of your choice; draw conclusions
* do some form of inference (e.g., a hypothesis test)
