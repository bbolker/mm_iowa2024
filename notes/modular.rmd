## Goals

* allow more flexible constructions, work around package limitations
* e.g. work-in-progress [phyloglmm](https://zenodo.org/records/2639887), [multimembership models](https://rpubs.com/bbolker/groupmembers), examples from [lmer vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf) appendix

## General steps

* construct `X`, `Z`, `Sigma`
