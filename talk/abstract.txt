Progress and challenges in open-source multilevel modeling

In parallel with the revolution in machine learning and AI, more
traditional multilevel models are gradually becoming more flexible,
powerful, and readily available in convenient open-source software. I
will give a brief overview of the current landscape of mixed modeling
tools, exciting new directions, and open challenges. I will focus on
methods available in R but touch on methods in Julia and Python, as well
as comparing to some commercial software. Other topics will include
model selection, troubleshooting (convergence and singular-fit
problems), and the use of latent variables to fit nonlinear patterns in
data.
